Forgotten

Easy challenge Crypto
I decided to try XOR encryption, but I forgot the secret key...

It is important to note that every string intended for encryption with XOR must be converted to an integer. XOR encryption is a symmetric encryption method, meaning the key can be used for both decryption and encryption. The resulting array of integers can then be utilized to examine flag.
I wrote a Perl script to find the secret key.With this script, you could use it for other challenges XOR as well.
